                <h1>Interests</h1>
                <p>There are a vast number of things that pique my interest and I truely wish there
                    is enough time in the day to contribute to every one of those interests. 
                    Unfortunately we only have 24 hours in a day and the interests that I choose 
                    to spend time on the most are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Programming</li>
                    <li>Tech</li>
                    <li>Gaming</li>
                    <li>DIY</li>
                    <li>Fitness</li>
                    
                </ul>
    
                <p>Recently I have started to develop interest in creating tools/add-ons to
                    programs and apps that my friends and I commonly use that can aggregate data and provide
                    useful functionality to complement those existing programs.
